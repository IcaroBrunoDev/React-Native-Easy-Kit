Introduction
The React Native Easy kit was developed to unify the best of the world of UI components and styling tools in a fast, performant and lightweight way, delivering easy-to-create functionalities and providing daily-uses components with a high abstraction level to improve your development experience.

About
This library was developed taken as inspiration the features of Stitches library (also Styled-Components), such as the easy way to create styled-components, possibility to create and apply your own theme and use tokenizing to apply styles onto your components and the ease of has components already done, such as Buttons, Typography with a low level of default styles, reducing the painful of customize components already made and the necessity of combine two or more libraries that doesnâ€™t talk each other (You have ever had to do that, we all had ðŸ˜Š).
This library aims to provide powerful functions that gives to you the power of css-in-js libraries such as styled functions, themes, tokenizing and styles inherit, while provides to you daily-uses components ready to use, improving your development time and reducing the necessity of spend hours configuring libraries and making it works.
This library isnâ€™t made by a team (unless you consider one developer as a team kkkk), it means that it could have failures and crash points, feel free to collaborate with your PR and contributors that want to improve this library are welcome, just send me a DM in my LinkedIn above.
