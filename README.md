## About

This library was created to supply the necessity of basic components that we as developers use on a daily basis, such as Button, Navbar, Fab and others, making the process of create beautiful designers more easy and reduce the pain of install

This library is designed to be lightweight, fast and responsive, which means that this library just uses pure React Native code without heavy third-party libraries help.

If you are looking for something simple, easy, and that really helps you with basic components without having to install an entire library to just use one simple component, this library is for you.

Below you can find all components that the library has. As it's grows, I'll keep you all updated.
